    My name is<em> Beimnet</em> Tesfaye. I was born in Ethiopia in small village called Debre birhan. Debre birhan is a small 
    town located 130 kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, it is a high land with a cold climate. The Average climate is 55oF.
I came from a small family; I have an older sister who still live in Ethiopia. My mom she used to be a <strong>teacher</strong> and my dad used to be 
a finance officer but they both are retire 2 years ago and now they are enjoying their retirement life.
I can say I was lucky and blessed to be from small town. Even though, we donâ€™t have too many options to choose from however, we had a lot of things 
to do. We used to make our own toys, we go to the nearby river and swim, we used to go to a nearby forest and play with animals, we used to sing a song 
and dance together and so on.For further reference please go to this link <href="https://google">
